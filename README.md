# Stanford-CS-193P

After Finishing CS193P This is...

# What I've Learned so far...

1. How Important it is to have a settings file which controls all those 'Blue Numbers' in the code
2. No matter how hard, how confusing, how complicated it seems at first, with enough effort, it will go down like the first `hello-world.cpp` file you ever made
3. Master MVC First, then move to other patterns, not the other way around or learn MVVM and MVC at the same time
4. That 'It Wokred!' Feeling is the best feeling you gonna ever get, especially in Assignment 3 where you have to draw the contents of the card yourself 
5. Copying code from Stack Overflow blindly is called Cheating!, understanding it and writing it is better, understanding it and comming up with your own version of the code is better!

# Tips

## In Concentration

1. make sure you perform MVC quite well!
2. the `Card.swift` should come up with it's own emoji, that should be in the model not the controller layer ;) 

## In Set
1. You can use attributed Strings instead of my solution of using images and use the emojis found in the required tasks section
2. sometimes nested for loops are the only solution to finding the possible sets on the board (but you may come up with a better solution)
3. Make sure you keep the controller layer in sync with the model layer (Computed Props and Observing properties might help)
4. Make sure you know which part of your code adds, removes and resize the cards on the board so when you move to animating the cards, it's easier to add animations and behaviours to the cards

## In Image Gallery
1. This is the easiest part, almost all the code you need is on Stack Overflow but make sure you don't just copy things and stick them into your code

## In General
1. Always read the Hints carefully, don't just skimm through it, read it and understand it and try to relate to it
2. Do the Reading Assignment, even if the topics are relevant to you, You never know what you may have missed on the beginning of your learning of Swift
3. Stay Positive
4. Stay Awesome!
